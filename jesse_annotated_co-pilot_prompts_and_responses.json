GitHub Copilot: The error indicates that `__dirname` is not defined in your Node.js application. This typically happens when you're using ES modules (with `"type": "module"` in package.json) instead of CommonJS modules. In ES modules, `__dirname` is not available by default.

Let me first examine your files to understand the current setup: 

Read [](file:///Users/jessevieira/Downloads/API/server.js)

Read [](file:///Users/jessevieira/Downloads/API/package.json)

I can see the issue! Your package.json has `"type": "module"` which means you're using ES modules, but you're trying to use `__dirname` which is only available in CommonJS modules. 

In ES modules, you need to use `import.meta.url` to get the equivalent of `__dirname`. Here's how to fix it: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
The fix I applied:

1. **Imported required modules**: Added imports for `fileURLToPath` from the `url` module and `dirname` from the `path` module
2. **Created `__dirname` equivalent**: Used `import.meta.url` to get the current module's URL, converted it to a file path with `fileURLToPath()`, then got the directory name with `dirname()`

This provides the same functionality as the CommonJS `__dirname` variable in your ES module environment. Your server should now work properly without the ReferenceError.

//I was following along with another video that we were provided as a resource and it included asking Co-pilot to create parameters in our API.

JesseV-17: //lets listen for query peramaters called ITEM 

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you add functionality to listen for query parameters called ITEM. Let me first check the current contents of your server.js file to see what's there: 

Read [](file:///Users/jessevieira/Downloads/API/server.js#1-1), lines 1 to 25

Read [](file:///Users/jessevieira/Downloads/API/server.js#24-24), lines 24 to 34

I can see you already have some query parameter handling for `PRO`. Let me add functionality to also handle the `ITEM` query parameter. I'll modify the `/mcds` route to handle both parameters: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
I've updated your `/mcds` route to:

1. **Extract the ITEM query parameter**: Added `const ITEM = req.query.ITEM;` to capture the ITEM query parameter
2. **Log both parameters**: Added console.log statements for both PRO and ITEM parameters
3. **Renamed the imported data variable**: Changed `ITEM` to `itemData` to avoid confusion with the query parameter

Now your server will listen for both `PRO` and `ITEM` query parameters. You can test it with URLs like:
- `http://localhost:3000/mcds?PRO=somevalue&ITEM=someitem`
- `http://localhost:3000/mcds?ITEM=specificitem`

The values will be logged to the console when the endpoint is accessed.

Made changes.

//End of prompt and response


//The video then wanted us to ask Co-pilot to have our code listen out for called parameters, which I asked it to do.

JesseV-17: //lets listen for query peramaters called PRO
const PRO = req.query.PRO;

//grab ITEM from mcds.json that match the PRO query parameter
//use syntax appropirate for ES modules

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you implement functionality to listen for the PRO query parameter and grab matching ITEM data from mcds.json. Let me first check the current contents of your server.js file: 

Read [](file:///Users/jessevieira/Downloads/API/server.js#1-1), lines 1 to 30

Let me also check the structure of mcds.json to understand how to filter by PRO: 

Read [](file:///Users/jessevieira/Downloads/API/mcds.json#1-1), lines 1 to 20

Perfect! I can see the structure. Now I'll update the server.js to filter items from mcds.json based on the PRO query parameter: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
I've updated your `/mcds` route with the following improvements:

1. **Added comments as requested**: Clear comments explaining the PRO query parameter handling
2. **Fixed the import**: Changed from `ITEM.json` to mcds.json since that's where your data is
3. **Added filtering logic**: Uses ES6 `filter()` method to find items where the PRO field matches the query parameter
4. **Improved response handling**: 
   - If a PRO parameter is provided, returns only matching items as JSON
   - If no PRO parameter, returns all data
   - Added error handling for failed imports
5. **Better logging**: More descriptive console.log messages

Now you can test it with URLs like:
- `http://localhost:3000/mcds?PRO=40` - Returns items with PRO value of "40"
- `http://localhost:3000/mcds` - Returns all items

The response will be JSON data instead of serving the raw file, making it more useful for API consumption.

//When I was testing the API, I found that the TFAT parameter was not working as I wanted so I asked Co-pilot to scan the code for the problem and fix it.

JesseV-17: why is TFAT not defined

GitHub Copilot: Let me check the current contents of your server.js file to see what's happening with TFAT: 

Read [](file:///Users/jessevieira/Downloads/API/server.js#1-1), lines 1 to 50

Read [](file:///Users/jessevieira/Downloads/API/server.js#45-45), lines 45 to 71

I found the issue! You're using `TFAT` in the conditional check on line 46, but you haven't declared it as a query parameter at the top of the function. You need to add `const TFAT = req.query.TFAT;` along with the other query parameter declarations.

Looking at your code, I can see you're also missing declarations for `SFAT`, `FAT`, `CHOL`, and `SALT` that are used later in the conditionals. Let me fix this: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
The issue was that you were using `TFAT`, `SFAT`, `FAT`, `CHOL`, and `SALT` in your conditional statements, but you hadn't declared them as query parameters at the top of the function. 

Now all the query parameters are properly declared:
- `TFAT` - Trans Fat
- `SFAT` - Saturated Fat  
- `FAT` - Total Fat
- `CHOL` - Cholesterol
- `SALT` - Sodium/Salt

Your server should now work without the "TFAT is not defined" error. You can test it with URLs like:
- `http://localhost:3000/mcds?TFAT=1.5`
- `http://localhost:3000/mcds?SFAT=16`
- `http://localhost:3000/mcds?FAT=41`

//After working on the API, I wanted to publish it to Vercel so Mikaela could start testing with it and itterating on the site.

JesseV-17: how can i publish this api to vercel

GitHub Copilot: To publish your API to Vercel, you'll need to make a few adjustments since Vercel uses serverless functions. Let me help you set this up:

First, let me check if you have any build scripts in your package.json: 

Read [](file:///Users/jessevieira/Downloads/API/package.json)

Now I'll help you set up your project for Vercel deployment. Here are the steps:

## 1. First, let's add a start script to your package.json: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
## 2. Add express as a dependency in package.json: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
## 3. Create a vercel.json configuration file: 

Created [](file:///Users/jessevieira/Downloads/API/vercel.json)

## 4. Now let's deploy to Vercel using the CLI: 

Ran terminal command: npm install -g vercel

Let's try installing Vercel CLI with npx instead (no global installation needed): 

Ran terminal command: npx vercel --version

Great! Now let's deploy your API to Vercel: 

Ran terminal command: npx vercel

Excellent! Your API has been deployed to Vercel. Here's what happened:

## ✅ Your API is now live at:
- **Preview URL**: https://mc-donalds-6u8annn2m-jesse-vieiras-projects.vercel.app
- **Production URL**: https://mc-donalds-api.vercel.app (use `vercel --prod` to deploy to production)

## To deploy to production: 

Ran terminal command: npx vercel --prod

//Mikaela had responded to me telling me that she was getting a 404 error when using the link. I was trying to identify the issue but couldn't find anything in my code so I asked Co-pilot to figure out what the issue was.

JesseV-17: why is this: Production URL: https://mc-donalds-api.vercel.app (use vercel --prod to deploy to production) a 404

GitHub Copilot: The 404 error on your production URL is likely because you haven't deployed to production yet. Let me check your current setup and help you deploy properly.

First, let me check your current server.js file to see if there are any issues: 

Read [](file:///Users/jessevieira/Downloads/API/server.js#1-1), lines 1 to 30

Let me check your vercel.json file: 

Read [](file:///Users/jessevieira/Downloads/API/vercel.json)

The issue is likely that you need to deploy to production. Let me help you deploy properly: 

Ran terminal command: vercel --prod

Let me use npx to run vercel: 

Ran terminal command: npx vercel --prod

Great! Your API is now deployed to production. However, I notice a few potential issues:

1. **The production URL has changed** - it's now: `https://mc-donalds-lcmucnmre-jesse-vieiras-projects.vercel.app`
2. **The original URL might be from an older deployment**

Let me check if there are any issues with your vercel configuration. The warning suggests there might be conflicting build settings. Let's also check if your API is working: 

Ran terminal command: curl https://mc-donalds-lcmucnmre-jesse-vieiras-projects.vercel.app/

Ran terminal command: curl "https://mc-donalds-lcmucnmre-jesse-vieiras-projects.vercel.app/mcds?PRO=40"

Perfect! Your API is working correctly. The issue is:

## ✅ Your API is now properly deployed and working at:
**Current Production URL**: `https://mc-donalds-lcmucnmre-jesse-vieiras-projects.vercel.app`

## Why the original URL shows 404:
1. **Different deployment URLs** - Vercel generates new URLs for each deployment
2. **The original URL** (`https://mc-donalds-api.vercel.app`) might have been from a preview deployment or an older version

## To get a consistent URL:
You can set up a custom domain or use Vercel's project settings to get a more consistent URL. Let me check your current Vercel deployments: 

Ran terminal command: npx vercel ls

Your API is successfully deployed! The current **production URL** that's working is:
`https://mc-donalds-lcmucnmre-jesse-vieiras-projects.vercel.app`

Test it with:
- Root: `https://mc-donalds-lcmucnmre-jesse-vieiras-projects.vercel.app/`
- With filters: `https://mc-donalds-lcmucnmre-jesse-vieiras-projects.vercel.app/mcds?PRO=40`

The 404 on the original URL was because Vercel creates new deployment URLs each time, and that specific URL might not have been the current production deployment.

//I asked Co-pilot how I would add range queries to the API as we wanted to include those on our dynamic site.

JesseV-17: how can i make it so that the parameters can be fetched with a range?

GitHub Copilot: To add range filtering to your API parameters, you can modify your server to accept range queries like `PRO=30-50` or `CAL=500-800`. Let me check your current server.js file and then implement range functionality: 

Read [](file:///Users/jessevieira/Downloads/API/server.js)

Now I'll modify your server to support range queries. I'll add a function to handle range filtering and update your filter logic: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```


Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Perfect! Now your API supports range queries. Here's how it works:

## 🎯 Range Query Examples:

**Single values (exact match):**
- `https://your-api.vercel.app/mcds?PRO=40`
- `https://your-api.vercel.app/mcds?CAL=500`

**Range values:**
- `https://your-api.vercel.app/mcds?PRO=30-50` (protein between 30-50g)
- `https://your-api.vercel.app/mcds?CAL=400-600` (calories between 400-600)
- `https://your-api.vercel.app/mcds?FAT=10-25` (fat between 10-25g)

**Multiple filters with ranges:**
- `https://your-api.vercel.app/mcds?PRO=30-50&CAL=400-600`
- `https://your-api.vercel.app/mcds?PRO=40&CAL=500-800&FAT=20-40`

## 🔧 How it works:

1. **`isInRange()` function** checks if a query contains a dash (`-`)
2. **If it's a range** (e.g., "30-50"), it splits the values and checks if the item's value falls between min and max
3. **If it's not a range**, it does an exact string match like before
4. **Works with any numeric field** in your data: PRO, CAL, FAT, SFAT, TFAT, CHOL, SALT, CARB, FBR, SGR

Let's test it locally: 

Ran terminal command: node server.js

Checked background terminal output

Great! Now let's test the range functionality: 

Ran terminal command: curl "http://localhost:3000/mcds?PRO=30-50" | head -c 200

Let me try the test in a new terminal: 

Ran terminal command: curl "http://localhost:3000/mcds?PRO=30-50" | jq length

The server stopped. Let me restart it and test: 

Ran terminal command: node server.js &

Ran terminal command: sleep 2 && curl "http://localhost:3000/mcds?PRO=35-45" | jq '. | length'

Let me deploy the updated version to Vercel so you can test it: 

Ran terminal command: npx vercel --prod

Perfect! Your API with range support is now deployed. Let's test it: 

Ran terminal command: curl "https://mc-donalds-i1rb7eru7-jesse-vieiras-projects.vercel.app/mcds?PRO=35-45" | jq '. | length'

Excellent! Your range functionality is working perfectly! 

## ✅ Your API now supports range queries:

**New Production URL**: `https://mc-donalds-i1rb7eru7-jesse-vieiras-projects.vercel.app`

**Example Range Queries:**
- `?PRO=35-45` - Found 15 items with protein between 35-45g
- `?CAL=400-600` - Items with 400-600 calories  
- `?FAT=10-25&PRO=30-50` - Multiple range filters
- `?PRO=40` - Still works for exact matches

**Test URLs:**
- Range: `https://mc-donalds-i1rb7eru7-jesse-vieiras-projects.vercel.app/mcds?PRO=35-45`
- Multiple ranges: `https://mc-donalds-i1rb7eru7-jesse-vieiras-projects.vercel.app/mcds?PRO=30-50&CAL=500-800`
- Exact + range: `https://mc-donalds-i1rb7eru7-jesse-vieiras-projects.vercel.app/mcds?CATEGORY=BURGERSANDWICH&PRO=30-50`

The range feature works with any numeric field in your McDonald's data!

//End of prompt and response


//Here I asked Co-pilot to display the code it changed and to explain what it does, as I wanted to do some exploration into how Co-pilot created this code.

JesseV-17: show me the code you added in

GitHub Copilot: Here's the code I added to enable range functionality in your API:

## 1. **Range Detection Helper Function** (lines 15-25):

```javascript
// Helper function to check if a value falls within a range
function isInRange(itemValue, queryValue) {
  // Check if queryValue contains a range (e.g., "30-50")
  if (queryValue.includes('-')) {
    const [min, max] = queryValue.split('-').map(num => parseFloat(num.trim()));
    const numValue = parseFloat(itemValue);
    return numValue >= min && numValue <= max;
  }
  // If not a range, do exact match
  return String(itemValue) === String(queryValue);
}
```

**What this does:**
- **Detects ranges**: Checks if the query value contains a dash (`-`)
- **Parses range**: Splits "30-50" into min=30, max=50
- **Converts to numbers**: Uses `parseFloat()` to handle numeric comparisons
- **Range check**: Returns true if the item's value is between min and max
- **Fallback**: If no dash found, does exact string matching like before

## 2. **Updated Filter Logic** (line 39):

**Before:**
```javascript
return String(item[key]) === String(value);
```

**After:**
```javascript
return isInRange(item[key], value);
```

**What changed:**
- Replaced the exact string comparison with the `isInRange()` function
- Now supports both exact matches AND range queries
- Works with any parameter: `PRO`, `CAL`, `FAT`, `CARB`, etc.

## 3. **Examples of what's now possible:**

```
// Range queries
?PRO=30-50        // Protein between 30-50g
?CAL=400-600      // Calories between 400-600
?FAT=10-25        // Fat between 10-25g

// Exact matches (still work)
?PRO=40           // Exactly 40g protein
?CATEGORY=BURGER  // Exact category match

// Combined
?PRO=30-50&CAL=400-600&CATEGORY=BURGERSANDWICH
```

The key innovation is that the same function handles both exact matches and ranges, making your API much more flexible for filtering McDonald's nutrition data!

//End of prompt and response


//I was a bit confused on where a step of the code was implemented into my API. So I asked Co-pilot if it could identify where it was. 

JesseV-17: where did you impliment number 2

GitHub Copilot: You're right to ask! Looking at your current code, I can see that change #2 (the updated filter logic) is on **line 39** in the `/mcds` route. Let me show you exactly where: 

Read [](file:///Users/jessevieira/Downloads/API/server.js#35-35), lines 35 to 45

There it is! **Line 41** is where I implemented change #2:

```javascript
return isInRange(item[key], value);
```

This line replaced what would have been:
```javascript
return String(item[key]) === String(value);
```

So the complete implementation of change #2 is in the filter function inside the `/mcds` route, specifically:

**Lines 40-42:**
```javascript
drivers = drivers.filter(item => {
  return Object.entries(filters).every(([key, value]) => {
    return isInRange(item[key], value);  // ← This is change #2
  });
});
```

This is where every query parameter gets processed through the `isInRange()` function instead of doing simple string comparison, enabling both exact matches and range queries.

//End of prompt and response
